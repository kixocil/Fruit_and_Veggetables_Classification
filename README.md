# Fruit_and_Veggetables_Classification
In this program I will create a neural network to distinguish between zucchini, pear, violent eggplant, cucumber, carrot, white cabbage, apple

To prepare the dataset I used ImageDataGenerator. The arguments for the ImageDataGenerator that I chose are horizontal_flip, vertical_flip. And then after that, the data will be put into the model.
